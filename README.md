# Image Classification Project (Work in Progress)

This project implements an image classification model using deep learning techniques, deployed as a web application using Streamlit. The model is trained to classify images into specific categories based on the features learned during training.

## Overview

The project leverages TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. The trained model is then integrated into a Streamlit application, providing a user-friendly interface for making predictions on uploaded images.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a CNN architecture for image classification.
- **Streamlit Web App:** Provides an intuitive interface to upload images and receive real-time predictions.
- **Preprocessing:** Includes image resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
- **Deployment:** Easily deployable on local environments or cloud platforms.

## Project Structure

The project structure includes the following components:

- **`model_training.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing code for model training and evaluation.
- **`app.py`**: Streamlit application script for deploying the trained model as a web app.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python packages required to run the project.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation providing an overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines (this file).
